# Survival of Keijo
Survival of Keijo is a game made with libGDX framework and Java and it is for Android and desktop.
Original plan was to make this game also for iOS (that is why there is the _**ios**_ folder), but that idea was abandoned.

(This project is incomplete. In the picture bellow, you shoot with an arrow down button.)

## Project structure

The code is in the _**core**_ folder and the assets are in the _**android/assets**_ folder.
The target platform (Android or desktop) specific code are in their own folders (_**android**_ or _**desktop**_).

Your goal is to try to survive from waves of armed enemies with weapons, which you can buy from the shop and also upgrade them in there.
